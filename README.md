this is a simple snake game that i have created using the help of the turtle and the window modeules in python.
This is a hands on project that can be done to learn some good logics.
In here, I've created 5 files named as data,food,main,scoreboard and snake and below I have described each of the files 
data- This file is used to  track the high score of the player in each round.
food - This file is corrospond to the food that have to created randomly when the snake eat a food dot.
main - This is the main file of this game and it connects all the files in the game.
scoreboard- This file is used to create the scoreboard that can be seen at the top of the game in order to show up the score of the player.
snake - This is the code file that everything abou the snake is included. From making the snake and how it behave when we press the keys of the keyboard..
